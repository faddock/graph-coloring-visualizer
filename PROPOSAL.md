Graph coloring algorithm (n-colorable grapher)

Design an application to color a graph_color based on graph_color theory. 
I have prior experience with this from my CS 173 Discrete structures class.
The idea is for the user to construct a graph_color using nodes_ and edges, and the algorithm then finds the chromatic number of the graph_color and visualizes it.

Week 1 - implement main algorithm to process nodes_ and points, and find chromatic number.
Week 2 - implement visualizer, with different colors_ 
Week 3 - implement graph_color constructing on cinder
additional - identify wheel, k-graph_color, hub, bipartite, etc.

The goal is to make it easier to understand the concept of graphs and coloring. 
I personally found this concept difficult to grasp, and having a visualizer would make it 
much more easier to understand.
